                The India Gate (formerly known as All India War Memorial) is a war memorial located near the Rajpath (officially called
            Kartavya path) on the eastern edge of the "ceremonial axis" of New Delhi. It stands as<mark> a memorial to 74,187 soldiers of
            the Indian Army who died </mark>between 1914 and 1921 in the First World War, in France, Flanders, Mesopotamia, Persia, East
            Africa, Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near and the Far East, and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. 13,300 servicemen's names,
            including some soldiers and officers from the United Kingdom, are inscribed on the gate.[2] Designed by Sir Edwin
            Lutyens, the gate evokes the architectural style of the ancient Roman triumphal arches such as the Arch of Constantine
            in Rome, and later memorial arches; it is often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the Gateway of India in
            Mumbai.</p></div>
